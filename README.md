# Elevational hologenomics

Data and code repository of the population-level metagenomic data of lizards across elevational gradients in various mountain ranges of the Pyrenees. The project aims to understand the role of gut microbes in hte adaptation to different climatic regions using a hologenomic approach.

## 1. Study design

Four different mountain transects, two on the Spanish side and two on the French side, were used to sample lizards across altitudinal gradients ranging from 900m to 2400 ASL. Per sampling point 4-5 individuals wre sampled to obtain faecal samples.
Metadata regarding all the samples can be found in X

## 3. Data analysis

Samples from the four transects were analysed together and the code used can be found in X
